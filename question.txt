    Book Management API





    Objective:


    Create a RESTful API using Express.js and Mongoose to perform basic CRUD operations on a collection of books.





    Requirements:





    Implement the following endpoints for the book resource:





    GET /books: Retrieve all books


    GET /books/:id: Retrieve a specific book by ID


    POST /books: Create a new book


    PUT /books/:id: Update a book by ID


    DELETE /books/:id: Delete a book by ID


    Define a book schema with the following fields:





    Title: Required, string


    Author: Required, string


    Description: Optional, string


    PublishedYear: Optional, number


    Connect the API to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.





    Implement the necessary routes and controllers to handle the CRUD operations for books.





    Use appropriate status codes and error handling for each API endpoint.





    Instructions:





    Set up a new Express.js project with the necessary dependencies (e.g., Express, Mongoose).





    Create a new file for the book model and define the book schema using Mongoose.





    Implement the API routes for the book resource in a separate file, following the specified endpoint paths and methods.





    Create controllers to handle the logic for each API endpoint. Implement the CRUD operations using Mongoose methods.





    Test the API using an API testing tool like Postman. Ensure that each endpoint works as expected and returns the appropriate responses.
